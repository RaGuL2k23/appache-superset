# Apache Superset Setup Instructions

---

## 1. Overview

This document guides you through setting up Apache Superset on your machine, including creating a secure configuration, activating the Python virtual environment, and creating an admin user.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* Virtualenv or venv created and activated
* Superset installed inside the virtual environment (`pip install apache-superset`)
* Git Bash or a Bash shell on Windows (or equivalent terminal on Linux/macOS)
* OpenSSL installed (to generate secure keys)

---

## 3. Step-by-step Setup

### Step 1: Create `superset_config.py` with a secure SECRET\_KEY

1. Open your terminal in the Superset project folder.
2. Run the following command to create a config file with a strong random SECRET\_KEY:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 42 > secret_key.txt
echo "import os

SECRET_KEY = \"$(cat secret_key.txt)\"
" > superset_config.py
rm secret_key.txt
```

*This creates a Python config file with a secure key.*

---

### Step 2: Set environment variables

Export these variables in the terminal session:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=superset
export SUPERSET_CONFIG_PATH=$(pwd)/superset_config.py
```

---

### Step 3: Activate your virtual environment

* On Linux/macOS/Git Bash:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

* On Windows CMD:

```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### Step 4: Create an admin user

Run this command:

```bash
superset fab create-admin
```

You will be prompted to enter:

* Username
* Password
* First Name
* Last Name
* Email

---

### Step 5: Start Superset server (optional)

```bash
superset db upgrade
superset init
superset run -p 8088 --with-threads --reload --debugger
```

---

## 4. Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: `bash: superset: command not found`

* **Cause:** Superset is not installed or virtual environment is not activated.
* **Fix:**

  * Activate your virtual environment first.
  * Install superset using `pip install apache-superset`.

---

### Issue 2: Warning about default SECRET\_KEY and refusal to start

* **Cause:** Superset requires a strong `SECRET_KEY` in `superset_config.py`.
* **Fix:**

  * Create or update `superset_config.py` with a strong SECRET\_KEY (see Step 1).

---

### Issue 3: Virtual environment activation issues on Windows

* Use `venv\Scripts\activate` in CMD or PowerShell.
* Use Git Bash for bash commands.

---

### Issue 4: Permission denied running script

* Run `chmod +x setup_superset.sh` to make it executable.
* Or run the commands manually if scripting is restricted.

---

## 5. Summary of commands to copy-paste (Linux/Mac/Git Bash)

```bash
openssl rand -base64 42 > secret_key.txt
echo "import os

SECRET_KEY = \"$(cat secret_key.txt)\"
" > superset_config.py
rm secret_key.txt

export FLASK_APP=superset
export SUPERSET_CONFIG_PATH=$(pwd)/superset_config.py

source venv/bin/activate

superset fab create-admin
```

---

## 6. Optional: Creating a script to automate (setup\_superset.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

openssl rand -base64 42 > secret_key.txt
echo "import os

SECRET_KEY = \"$(cat secret_key.txt)\"
" > superset_config.py
rm secret_key.txt

export FLASK_APP=superset
export SUPERSET_CONFIG_PATH=$(pwd)/superset_config.py

source venv/bin/activate

superset fab create-admin
```

Run `chmod +x setup_superset.sh` then `./setup_superset.sh`

---

If you follow these steps, you should have a secure, working Superset admin user ready to go.
