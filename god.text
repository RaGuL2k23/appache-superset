📊 Step 2: Use Dashboard Cross-Filters
This lets you click on one chart and filter another—like a basic drill down.

Example:
Chart A: Bar chart of Sales by Region

Chart B: Table of Sales Details

Steps:

Build both charts.

Put them on the same dashboard.

In dashboard view, click a bar (region) in Chart A.

Chart B automatically updates to show just that region’s data — like drilling into it!

✅ That’s a simple and very visual "drill-down".

🖱️ Step 3: Use Drill to Detail (Right-click Option)
This allows users to right-click a chart element and see the row-level data.

Example with Pie or Bar Chart:
Add a Chart (e.g., Pie chart of Sales by Category).

In chart settings:

Enable "Emit Filter Events" or "Enable Cross Filtering" if available.

Save and add it to a dashboard.

In dashboard mode:

Right-click a slice/bar.

Choose “Drill to detail”.

Superset will show the table of records that contributed to that data point.

You can control what data fields show up in the "Drill to Detail" via your dataset's column settings.
